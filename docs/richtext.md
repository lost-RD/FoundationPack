**richtext** is a text and image formatting library for the
[LÃ–VE](http://love2d.org/) framework.

# usage

    local rich = require 'richtext'

    rt = rich.new{"Hello {green}world{red}, {smile} {big}Big text.", 200,
                  black = {0, 0, 0}, green = {0, 255, 0},
                  big = love.graphics.newFont(20), red = {255, 0, 0},
                  smile = love.graphics.newImage('smile.png')}

    function love.draw()
        rt:draw(10, 10)
    end

# features

* automatically pads images to [PO2](http://love2d.org/wiki/PO2_Syndrome),
  without any alignment problems

* wraps words and images together

# current issues

* richtext is still not well-tested

* word wrapping might not be optimally done, because it always splits the first
  word, which might lead to a lot of splitting (the end result is fine, though)

* words keep their final space in wrapping, which may cause words to be wrapped
  just a bit too soon

* any initial text color (other than white) has to be specified manually by
  starting text
